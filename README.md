# Week 2 HW
## Description
This project involved building our own portfolio website and utilizing the components from Bootstrap's CCS utilities to stylized our webpage.

## Learning Experience
During this project, I learned how to build my own webpage using Bootstrap. It was a frustrating experience at times, and at other times it was rewarding. This project involved a lot of trial and error. I used Chrome's Dev Tools a lot more towards the end, to understand what space a certain element was taking up. 

More importantly, I learned how to read, re-read, and then read again to understand what the documentation is telling me. It took a good while to finally understand some of the concepts with Bootstraps. 

Reading up on Flexbox, through CCS-Trick's website also proved to be instrumental in understanding a lot of the web design concepts.
